            <p class="head">
                This is an experiment to implement a simple game
                that embraces a spiritual concept.
            </p>

            <p>
                “The reason why the Saints were so perfectly recollected 
                is that they always sought to abstain from wordly desires, 
                leaving themselves free to give their whole heart to God.“<br>
                &mdash; Imitation of Christ Book 1, Chp. 12
            </p>
                
                
            <p> This focuses on what it looks like to remove 
                    vices <b>as quickly as possible
                </b> (within the rules of the game)
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar to Conway's Game of Life, you select certain tiles 
                on cells to make them vices, then you simply observe the changes
                between Grace and vice.
            </p>
            <h4>0.1 Vice</h4>
            <p>
                
                <b> What is it?</b><br>
                I've defined it as literally anything you're attatched to. 
                Everything will be gone from you at the 
                end of your life, so overeagerness for anything: to keep your friends,
                your health, to do well in school, works against you.<sup>1&mdash;3</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Implementation</b><br>
                The table is empty at first. Clicking and dragging over cells make
                them vices. If a cell is a vice it can either:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Harden</b>&mdash; being surrounded by vices make them harder to remove</li>
                    <li><b>Go Away</b>&mdash; if they're not surrounded you can remove them youself,
                    otherwise you'll need the help of Grace.</li>
                    <li><b>Grow</b>&mdash;vices can spread to other empty cells</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>0.2 Grace</h4>
            <p>
                
                <b> What is it?</b><br>
                I've defined as literally anything you're attatched to. 
                It is in our best effort to leave ourselves free
                for God. Everything will gone from you at the 
                end of your life, so overeagerness anything: to keep your friends,
                your health, to do well in school, is working against you.<sup>1&mdash;3</sup>
